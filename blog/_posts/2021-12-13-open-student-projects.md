We do open science, and we take project students.
It was hard getting projects to work well, we learned a lot, and so we wrote about it.

Our piece on [The benefits of open science in student research projects](/papers/paper/open-student-projects) 
is now published at [The Biochemist magazine](https://portlandpress.com/biochemist/Ahead-of-Issue-articles), the member journal of The Biochemical Society.


We found that to design a good student project, it helps to:

- Plan project outcomes so that everybody wins. 
- Plan a pathway from novice to expert within the project.

One surprise of writing this how how little we could find already written about running successful short research projects for students, at all.
If you know other articles on this, or want to write one, let us know, we are interested!

We do open science, and take project students.
It was hard getting this to work, we learned a lot, and so we wrote about it.

Our piece on [The benefits of open science in student research projects](papers/open-student-projects) 
is now published at [The Biochemist magazine](https://portlandpress.com/biochemist/Ahead-of-Issue-articles), the member journal of The Biochemical Society.

One surprise of writing this how how little we could find already written about running successful short research projects for students, at all.
If you know other articles on this, or want to write one, let us know, we are interested!

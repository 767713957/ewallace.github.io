# Meetings

This page is covers basic expectations for meetings in the lab:

* Lab meetings for everyone (weekly except holidays)
* Subgroup meetings (new for 2021)
* 1-1 meetings (fortnightly)


# Lab meetings for everyone (weekly except holidays)


# Subgroup meetings (new for 2021)


# 1-1 meetings (fortnightly)

Most lab members have 1-1 meetings with Edward, fortnightly.
These guidelines are to make these meetings most pleasant and productive.

Project students will find these guidelines useful to make the most of their meetings with Edward and any co-supervisors, although the meetings may have a different frequency or format.

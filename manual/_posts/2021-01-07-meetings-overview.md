# Meetings

This page is covers basic expectations for meetings in the lab:

* Lab meetings for everyone (weekly except holidays)
* Subgroup meetings (new for 2021)
* 1-1 meetings (fortnightly)


# Lab meetings for everyone (weekly except holidays)

Lab meetings are the regular opportunity for the whole group to come together to talk about science, and about important logistics.

Lab meetings can take various formats:

* Research update, led by a single lab member - this is most common
* Journal club
* Guest presentation from someone outside the lab
* Other - for example, a "welcome back" meeting, a "write some of the lab manual" meeting, a "state of the lab" annual-ish meeting

Whatever the format, the goal of lab meeting is for everyone in the room, including the presenter, to learn as much as possible.

## Timing - *updated January 2021*

Lab meetings are *15:30-17:00 Mondays* on zoom; see calendar invite for the zoom link.

We have historically tried to keep lab meetings to 1 hour, but they ended up closer to 1 and a half.
So our new approach is:

* 15:00 meeting opens, we can drift in with coffee/tea, chat and discuss lab business
* 15:30 prompt, presentation starts
* 16:45 whatever slide the presenter is on, it's their last slide
* 17:00 everyone should leave

## Giving a Research update lab meeting

Giving a research update lab meeting - a talk with slides - serves multiple purposes:

* Updating the group on your project
* Articulating what you are thinking about the project and its future
* Soliciting feedback and ideas from other lab members
* Practising for talks outside the lab, in a friendly environment.

The key point is that the presentation must be accessible to everyone in the lab.
There is always a new student who hasn't heard about your project before, and also there are people who have heard you talk many times before. The talk must be accessible to all of them, which requires telling a clear story. This includes:

* give an introduction to your project, highlighting important ideas and objects
* include a small number of crucial results from elsewhere, appropriately references
* make it clear when the talk shifts to your results
* present some primary data
* 

Newer lab members will usually present plans for future work, not any new data. This is great! A well-thought-out lab meeting leads to  

# Subgroup meetings (new for 2021)


# 1-1 meetings (fortnightly)

Most lab members have 1-1 meetings with Edward, fortnightly.
These guidelines are to make these meetings most pleasant and productive.

Project students will find these guidelines useful to make the most of their meetings with Edward and any co-supervisors, although the meetings may have a different frequency or format.

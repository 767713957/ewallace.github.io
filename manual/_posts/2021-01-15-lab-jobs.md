# Shared jobs in the wet lab

In order to share communal equipment and reagents fairly amongst lab members, each person who works in the wet lab is allocated a number of jobs.
These jobs are necessary to ensure the lab runs smoothly.
Our goal is to ensure that jobs are shared equitably and efficiently; please talk to Rosey and/or Edward about any issues.

This page details which jobs each lab member is assigned responsibility for. 
Most jobs are allocated to more than one person to ensure that jobs are done if someone is away.
More details on individual jobs are given in the notes, below.

## Notes

### Inventory and ordering

"Communal Lab Orders" means those which are shared with other groups in Waddington 2.18.

The inventory and ordering system is (will be) described in ["where lab stuff belongs" manual page](where-lab-stuff-belongs).
Everyone is responsible for keeping track of lab stocks of consumables and updating the inventory.
No-one wants to interrupt an experiment because stocks of some reagent or consumable are low.

Plan ahead: if you are planning to run 100 PCR reactions in 2 weeks' time, check the polymerase stocks and order more now.
If in doubt, talk about it on the #lab channel on slack.

### Looking after an instrument 

This usually involves:

* being familiar with the user manual and its location
* ensuring that the machine is clean and functional
* checking on maintenance requirements
* training new users
* keeping an eye on use, e.g. users acting erroneously or not cleaning up after themselves. 
* communicating about problems

### Competent cells

Explanation and link to protocol needed here.

# Lab cleanup

Every 1-2 months we will organize a lab cleanup, in which everyone is expected to participate.
Usually (before COVID-19) we did these jointly with other groups in Wad 2.19.

Lab cleanups include:

* incubators
* centrifuge
* fridges
* throwing out old solutions, media, plates
* etc....

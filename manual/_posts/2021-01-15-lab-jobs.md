#Lab Jobs

In order to share communal equipment and reagents fairly amongst lab staff, each person is allocated a number of jobs which are necessary to ensure the lab runs smoothly. 

The following table details which jobs each lab member is expected to take responsibility for. Most jobs are allocated to more than one person to ensure that jobs are done if someone is off /on holiday.

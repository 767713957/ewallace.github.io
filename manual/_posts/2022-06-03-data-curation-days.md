# Why we need Data Curation Days

It is vitally important to organise and curate data and reagents in the lab, as described in [data management plan](data-management-plan) and [where data belongs](where-data-belongs).
It's also essential to update [lab notebooks](lab-notebook).

No-one is perfect and it can be tempting to procrastinate/postpone these tasks.
For that reason, we organise data curation days every 1-3 months to make sure they happen.

Thanks to [Andrew Millar](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/andrew-millar) and [Karrera Djoko](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/karrera-djoko/) for explaining data curation days.
They were emphatic about the importance of cake and/or hot chocolate to the success of the process.

# How a Data Curation Day works

Practicalities:

- Scheduled at least 1 week in advance, announced on slack and lab calendar.
- Usually run from 10am to 3:30pm, breaking for lunch.
- No other work to be done during data curation day: data curation only.
- Data curation is work.
- PI orders cake for the office.
- Someone volunteers to make coffee for 10am.
- The day starts by everyone sharing their goals for data curation day. Usually this is as a [stand-up post](standup).
- Discuss with others and make plans for joint data curation in advance if possible.
- Update at end of day with which goals were achieved and any loose ends.
- PI also agrees to buy a pint for anyone who wants one after work.

Data curation could include:

- anything that helps us organise any of our data.
- plasmid info.
- strain info.
- submission of RNA-seq data to GEO.
- cleaning up and/or documenting datastore.
- new releases of github repos, minting dois on figshare, etc.
- writing README files for datastore folders or github directories.
- any other data archiving.
- updating lab notebooks.
- adding to or updating lab manual.
- updating lab website.
- discussion of how we should organise data and materials.
- freezer organisation and documentation.
- and so on...

## What about lab cleanups?

Data curation day is sort of the dry lab equivalent of a wet lab cleanup.
We occasionally have lab cleanups.
We don't yet have a manual page for lab cleanups.

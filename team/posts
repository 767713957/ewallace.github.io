Caroline She is a postgraduate student currently pursuing her Master's degree in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. She joined the Wallace lab in May 2023 to do a bioinformatics dissertation project titled "A Modern Bioinformatics Pipeline to Understand Protein Synthesis from Big Data". Leveraging the robust and reliable ribosome profiling analysis software package, "riboviz2", Caroline aims to build a more user-friendly ribosome profiling analysis pipeline using Nextflow2. The pipeline will be tested by re-analysing publicly available data.

Caroline previously graduated with a degree in Medical Biochemistry from Swansea University in 2021.

Farewell [Jing Qi Chong](team/jingqi-chong), who is moving on after doing a very nice Honours project analysing data on RNA-binding proteins.

Welcome to Eleanor Donohoe and Marcos Bermejo, who are both working on MSc Bioinformatics projects related to [riboviz ribosome profiling data analysis](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz).

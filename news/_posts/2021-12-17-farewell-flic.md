[Flic](/team/flic-anderson) is leaving the lab after 2.5 years! 
Flic has worked on riboviz bioinformatics, directly supervised several student projects, taught data skills as a Carpentries instructor, including with [Ed-DaSH](https://edcarp.github.io/Ed-DaSH/index.html).

Flic's next step is a PhD studying research software practice at [epcc](http://epcc.ed.ac.uk). We will miss her, but she will not be far away.

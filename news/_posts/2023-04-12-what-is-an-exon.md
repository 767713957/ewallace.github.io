[We wrote a review paper on the original definition of exon and its importance ](/papers/paper/what-is-an-exon).
Not all exons are protein-coding!!!

This was a lovely collaboration with [Julie Aspden](https://aspdenlab.weebly.com) and [Nicky Whiffin](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/people/nicola-whiffin).

[Mighty twitter thread explaining the paper (aka tweetorial)](https://twitter.com/nickywhiffin/status/1646165211135586305).
